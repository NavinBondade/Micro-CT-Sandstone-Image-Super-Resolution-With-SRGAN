<p>Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) silicate grains. It comprises about 20â€“25% of all sedimentary rocks. In this project, I have implemented and trained the Super Resolution GAN (SRGAN) deep learning model for performing image upscaling from the resolution of 64x64 to 256x256.</p>

<h2>What is Super Resolution GAN?</h2>
<p>Super-resolution GAN applies a deep network in combination with an adversary network to produce higher resolution images. During the training, A high-resolution image (HR) is downsampled to a low-resolution image (LR). A GAN generator upsamples LR images to super-resolution images (SR). We use a discriminator to distinguish the HR images and backpropagate the GAN loss to train the discriminator and the generator.</p>
<p>It uses a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes the solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, the authors use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space.</p>
